# DynoWare-Free
a simple program to log data from a Dyn-200 dynamic torque transducer
this program uses an FTDI based rs485 to usb cable to interface the rs485 output of a dyn-200 dynamometer.
It gets accurate Speed and Torque readings (in RPM and N-M respectively. 

I also have cobbled together a script to pull CAN data from a vesc, using an INNOMAKER usb can adapter, and parse out vesc data for efficiency logging.
